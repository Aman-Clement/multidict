Reverted to using the public argument parsing API
:c:func:`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords` under Python 3.12
-- by :user:`charles-dyfis-net` and :user:`webknjaz`.

The effect is that this change prevents build failures with
clang 16.9.6 and gcc-14 reported in :issue:`926`. It also
fixes a segmentation fault crash caused by passing keyword
arguments to :py:meth:`MultiDict.getall()
<multidict.MultiDict.getall>` discovered by :user:`jonaslb`
and :user:`hroncok` while examining the problem.
